"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

"""
#Create a List:

# list= ["fruits", "veg" , "nonveg"]
# print(list)
# print(list.index("veg"))
# print(list.pop(1))
# print(list)

"""

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
"""

list= ["fruits", "veg" , "nonveg" , "veg"]
print(list)
# print(list.index("veg"))
# print(type(list))
